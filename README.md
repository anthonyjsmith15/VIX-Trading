# VIX-Trading
A trading system for automated trade placement on the Volatility Index

The methodology utilised functions best when the VIX is swinging between 32 and 20 on a monthly basis. As the chart narrows or expands, buy and sell signals are issued or tighten stop signals are issued.

The code is written to plug into IG Index for automated trading.

No responsibility for losses is given, spread betting is a risky investment.
